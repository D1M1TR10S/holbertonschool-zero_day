What is a virtual machine? A Virtual Machine is an artificial emulation of a computer system. It allows you to work in an operating system contained within your Virtual Machine Software. Itâ€™s benefits are that it protects you in case a virus or crash happens, as it would not affect your actual computer, and it allows you to use a separate OS such as Ubuntu or Windows, from a Mac computer.
